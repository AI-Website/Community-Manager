# Community-Manager
Even with the best A.I. in the world, there is still room for Humans! We call these "Community Managers". In the WikiGraph model, they are Elected and play a leadership role for the Content, Organization, Look &amp; Feel, and tracking traffic &amp; success of each community.

The Community Manager's homescreen UI is inspired by Drupal Workbench Suite: https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/workbench https://www.drupal.org/project/workbench
